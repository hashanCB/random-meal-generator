# Random Meal Generator - #001 of #100Days100Projects

Welcome to my #100Days100Projects journey! This is project #001, where I explore the usage of client and server methods in the latest version of NextJS. In this project, I have implemented a Random Meal Generator.

## Project Overview

The Random Meal Generator is a simple web application that utilizes the [MealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php) to fetch a random meal. The application makes use of both client-side and server-side functionality implemented in NestJS.

## Technologies Used

- NestJS
- React (or your preferred frontend library/framework)
- Fetch API

## How it Works

1. The frontend initiates a request to the MealDB API to get a random meal using the Fetch API.
2. The response from the API is stored using the `useState` hook in the React component.
3. The website dynamically updates to display information about the fetched random meal.


## Challenges and Learning

Throughout this project, I encountered challenges and learned valuable lessons, including working with NestJS, using the Fetch API to communicate with external APIs, and managing state in a React application.

Stay tuned for the next projects in my #100Days100Projects journey! Happy coding! ðŸš€
